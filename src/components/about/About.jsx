        <p>I am a fullstack developer currently based in London, UK. Originally from a successful background in clinical medicine, I have always thrived in agile environments that allow me to find creative solutions to complex problems.</p>
        <p>Although I have since swapped my stethoscope for a MacBook I have spent my professional career relishing any opportunity to communicate my ideas with others, whether that be as a teaching assistant at Le Wagon, or discussing challenging ideas with clients and stakeholders.</p>
        <p>It is this diverse skillset which I utilise in order to create impact.</p>
